<!--Inline display element only takes up as much space as it needs to from its height and width.

<!-- Though a paragraph by default is a BLOCK element, we can change its display value by using *display: inline* 
    which will allow everything to sit on the same line as everything else.    -->

<!--You can change the display property of our INLINE ELEMENTS to BLOCK ELEMENTS
    this will allow us to change our width but it will not let them be put on the same line.-->

<!-- Inline BLOCK (best of both worlds) instead of changing the (P) element to inline, you can change it 
    (inline-block) you can change its width now and you can also make them sit on the same line,
    like (inline elements) -->

<!-- POSITION -->

<!--STATIC =  
            All HTML elements are Static in their position by default: Static just means
            go along with the HTML rules and keep to the HTML flow. -->
<!--RELATIVE =
          This will allow us to position the element we select, realitve to how it would have been positioned
            if it was Static. 
         When you move an element that has a relative position, it will not affect anything else on screen.
             -->

<!--ABSOLUTE = 
            We are positiong the element, relative to its PARENT.
            YOU ARE ADDING A MARGIN TO THE PARENT ELEMENT -->
